# doomsday

 
Pitch: Prepare a "Doomsday" event for Techem to train for outages and service stability. With Chaos Engineering Experiments we shut off different parts of our system and let groups of developers try to fix it.
This will likely have multiple Benefits:


	
Teams get used to work with Kubernetes and Monitoring Tools better
	
Teams understand their or other Products better
	
Blind spots are discovered, e.g. in Observability
	
Confidence in shipping increases because teams get a better understanding of possible occuring problems

Feasability for Techem: This could be very beneficial and a "framework" approach would help other teams to host these events themselves. The cultural impact is propably wanted by Leadership. We asked this a while ago and it was well received.
